Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  for ( var x=0; x<numbers.length; x++) // adding a for loop to get all the items from numbers starting with 0 
  for (var y=x+1; y<numbers.length; y++) // added x with the next index 1 through all the loop 
    if (numbers[x] + numbers[y] === target) return [x,y];  // adding all numbers x and y that will only give us the target number and returns x and y in a array 
}
